# Problems:
# 1) `invalid_link` node contains an invalid key reference
# 2) `invalid_dialogue` did not specify dialogue correctly
# 3) `invalid_link` is not a real node key, e.g. does not exist
# 4) `invalid_dialogue` is an orphan node (not reachable)
# 5) `valid` is a leaf node but also the entry point (root node)
